Calculate simple interest by gathering three things (principle, number of years, rate of interest).
Get user input for p (p = principle).
Get user input for n (n = number of years).
Get user input for r (r = rate of interest).
Convert user inputs p, n, r to int().Links to an external site.
Calculate the simple interest of p, n, r (multiple p, n, r, and then divide by 100).
Print out the simple interest value.
Part 2
Create a list of your favorite food items, the list should have a minimum of 5 elements.
List out the 3rd element in the list.
Add additional items to the current list and display the list.
Insert an element named tacos at the 3rd index of the list and print out the list elements.
